# Document-Indexing-and-Search-Engine-Simulation-in-C-
This C++ program simulates a document indexing and search engine. It processes text, tokenizes words, and uses hashmaps for efficient indexing. It allows searches using logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) to find line numbers of matches in a document.
